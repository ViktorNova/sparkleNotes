sparkleNotes
============

A note taking application with sparkleShare sync. 
SparkleNote should be easy to port to various platform which support Qt5, as it s written in pure Qml/C++

Currently in experimentation / devel, nothing finished nor tested, sync part
not yet implemented, use this at your own risk, nuclear winter can happen ...

The code is licenced under GPLv3, except most components located in
src/qml/KComponents which come from the touch reference UI of gPodder and are a
bit modified. I need to clean up the licence mess ...
